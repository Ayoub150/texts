The delights of Paradise surpass the imagination and defy description.  They are like nothing known to the people of this world; no matter how advanced we may become, what we achieve is as nothing in comparison with the joys of the Hereafter.  As is mentioned in several reports, there is nothing like Paradise: <br><br>

“It is sparkling light, aromatic plants, a lofty palace, a flowing river, ripe fruit, a beautiful wife and abundant clothing, in an eternal abode of radiant joy, in beautiful soundly-constructed high houses”. (Ibn Maajah, Ibn Hibbaan) <br><br>

The Sahabah asked the Prophet about the buildings of Paradise and he replied with a wonderful description:<br><br>

“Bricks of gold and silver, and mortar of fragrant musk, pebbles of pearl and sapphire, and soil of saffron.  Whoever enters it is filled with joy and will never feel miserable; he will live there forever and never die; their clothes will never wear out and their youth will never fade.” (Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, ad-Daarimee)
<br><br>
God says: <br><br>

“And when you look there (in Paradise) you will see a delight (that cannot be imagined), and a great dominion.” (Quran 76:20)<br><br>

What God has kept hidden from us the delights of Paradise is beyond our ability to comprehend.  The Prophet said that God said:
<br><br>
“I have prepared for My slaves what no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no human heart can imagine.”  Recite ifc you wish:<br><br>

“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.” (Quran 32:17)<br><br>

In another report:<br><br>

“Never mind what God has told you; what He has not told you is even greater.” (Saheeh Muslim)
