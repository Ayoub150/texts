They will only hear good words and words of peace. God says: <br><br> “They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin. But only the saying of: Peace! Peace!” (Quran 56:25-26) There will be no enmity between people nor ill-feelings: <br><br>“And We shall remove from their breasts any (mutual) hatred or sense of injury (which they had, if at all, in the life of this world)…” (Quran 7:43) The Prophet said: “There will be no hatred or resentment among them, their hearts will be as one, and they will glorify God, morning and evening.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari) People will have the best of companions in the Hereafter, who were also the best people in the world: <br><br> “And whoever obeys God and the Messenger – those will be with the ones upon whom God has bestowed favor – of the prophets, the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions!” (Quran 4:69)   <br><br>The hearts of the people of Paradise will be pure, their speech will be good, their deeds righteous. There will be no hurtful, upsetting, offensive or provocative talk there, for Paradise is free of all worthless words and deeds. If we were to discuss all the causes for anguish in this life, we would surely find its absence or opposite to be true in Paradise.

<h6>The Eternalness of the Hereafter</h6> The Pleasures of this world are transient whilst the joys of the hereafter are lasting and eternal.  In this life when a person enjoys something, it is only a short while before they get bored with it and proceed to search for something they feel is better, or they may not feel a need for it altogether. <br>As for the delights of Paradise, a person will never feel bored with anything, but rather, its goodness will increase each time they indulge in it. Also, the life of this world is very short.  Humans only live on this earth for a short while, and very few people reach the age of seventy. “…Say:<br><br> Short is the enjoyment of this world.  The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears God…” (Quran 4:77) As for Paradise, people will live forever.  God says: “…its provision is eternal and so is its shade…” (Quran 13:35) “What is with you must vanish, and what is with God will endure …” (Quran 16:96) “(It will be said to them): This is Our Provision, which will never finish” (Quran 38:54) <h6>Superior Delights</h6> The delights of the people of Paradise, such as their clothing, food, drink, jewelry and palaces, will be far superior to their counterparts in this world. <br><br>There is in fact no room for comparison, as even the smallest space in Paradise is better than this world and all that is in it.  The Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, said: “The space of the bow of any one of you in Paradise is better than all that the sun rises upon” (Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh 3/85, no. 5615) <br><br>
